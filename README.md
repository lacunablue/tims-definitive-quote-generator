# tims-definitive-quote-generator
Random quotes I like selected and displayed at random by clicking the die. 

Created using HTML, CSS, JS, and Inkscape to create dice .svg.

TO DO
- [ ] Change from on hover to on click for animation, then add JS slight delay (wait until dice animation done or almost done) before random quote is generated
- [X] Incorporate JSON
- [ ] Separate quote-text and quote-source, stylize further within HTML/CSS
- [ ] Create "roll" dice animation rather than shimmy animation
- [ ] Increase quote database
