# tims-definitive-quote-generator
Random quotes I like selected and displayed at random by clicking the die. 

Created using HTML, CSS, JS, and Inkscape to create dice .svg.

Planned updates:
- change from on hover to on click for animation, then add JS slight delay (wait until dice animation done or almost done) before random quote is generated
- incorporate JSON and separate quote-text and quote-source, stylize further within HTML/CSS
- "roll" dice animation rather than shimmy animation
- increase quote database
